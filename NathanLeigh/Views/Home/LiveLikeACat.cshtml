        When someone asked me as a kid what I would want to be when I grow up I always picked a cat,
        I can see why the ancient Egyptians revered them as sacred animals. Pet cats get waited on hand and foot by their envious owners,
        they live a stress free, enjoyable life. I keep seeing new incredible advances in Science, Technology, Robotics, AI and Automation
        and this website explains how they will allow society to have all their necessities taken care and allow more time spent on hobbies
        and passions and allow me to fulfill my life long dream of living like a cat.
