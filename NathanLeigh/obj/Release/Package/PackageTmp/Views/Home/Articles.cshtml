Cognitive computing like IBM’s Watson is giving computers the ability to “think”, which has the potential to disrupt a wide range of occupations. Computer power will become exponentially more powerful and AI algorithms being fed Big Data from the Internet of Things will evolve from Smart Assistants like Siri, into Smart Workers and Smart Bosses and even to Smart Teachers and Doctors within the next 20 years.

Service robots are opening new contexts for productivity gains beyond what industrial robots have done. The capabilities of robots will increase and their price will drops over the next 20 years, resulting in disruption for many occupations.">

This will allow products to be delivered to wherever you want, whenever you want and much quicker and cheaper than currently possible, creating a new level of convenience that some brick and mortar stores may struggle to compete with.

This article illustrates that this solution is not so simple and shows how even STEM jobs are not immune from disruption in the near future due to new technologies. ">

We can prevent people from having to needlessly suffer and turn this coming disruption into a situation where we can all more equally enjoy the wealth the machines can bring us. ">

I also show the unequal opportunity and discrimination a child of a certain race and/or gender currently faces. Finally I predict how a disenfranchised group of young men may develop as they are less likely to gain the higher skills vital to participate in the future global job market and some of the issues this could cause on a local and global scale.

I discuss policies and changes in culture which I believe will help us all more equally enjoy the abundance technology can bring. Last of all I highlight the main reason for my current optimism for the future and why I believe the policy solutions I discuss can be put in place soon, to better prepare us and to ease the continuous disruption as we transition into a digital age.
